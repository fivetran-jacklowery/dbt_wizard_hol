  Core workflow for building dashboards and reports with Dataface. Use when
  creating new dashboards, editing existing YAML, adding charts, writing
  queries, iterating on layout, or when the user says 'build a dashboard',
  'create a report', 'add a chart', 'write a query'. Covers the
  build-test-iterate cycle, parameterized queries, caching, and incremental
  development. Do NOT use for diagnosing errors after something breaks (use
  dataface-troubleshooting). Do NOT use for design decisions about
  chart types or layout patterns (use dashboard-design or
  report-design).

# Building Dataface Dashboards

**`dft render` is how you deliver a dashboard** — call it and return its output. Do not skip it.

Build dashboards and reports **incrementally** — one chart at a time, validating at every step. Never one-shot an entire dashboard.

## Companion Skills

- **`dft skills dashboard-design`** — chart-type, layout, and color decisions
- **`dft skills report-design`** — narrative reports (text + charts)
- **`dft skills dashboard-review`** — self-review checklist run at delivery
- **`dft skills dataface-troubleshooting`** — when something breaks

YAML field reference is `dft docs` (overview), `dft docs <topic>` (one
section in depth), and `dft docs -s "<query>"` (full-text search).


## Metadata Requirement

Fill `description` on every named object — agents downstream rely on it for context and search:

- `queries.*.description` — what the query returns and why it exists
- `charts.*.description` — what question the chart answers
- `variables.*.description` — how the variable should be used
- Layout objects (`rows`/`cols`/`grid.items`/`tabs.items`) — section intent when useful

Keep each description short and factual (one sentence).

## The Workflow

### Step 1 — Explore the Data

Use `dft schema` to drill source → schema → table → column, and `dft schema -s <kw>` for keyword search across the corpus.

Use `dft query` to verify cardinality and sample values before writing any YAML:

```sql
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM orders GROUP BY status;
```

**Do not skip this step.** Writing SQL against assumed column names is the #1 source of errors.

### Step 2 — Build One Chart

Write a minimal YAML with a single query and chart:

```yaml
source: my_profile
queries:
  revenue:
    sql: SELECT date, SUM(amount) AS total FROM orders GROUP BY date ORDER BY date
charts:
  revenue_trend:
    query: revenue
    type: line
    x: date
    y: total
rows:
  - revenue_trend
```

Then verify with two calls:

1. `dft query` — confirm the data shape and columns
2. `dft render` — compile + render to see the visual

### Step 3 — Iterate on That Chart

Adjust SQL, chart type, labels, colors. Run `dft render <path>` to see the visual result — queries are cached after first execution, so re-rendering is nearly instant.

### Step 4 — Add the Next Chart

Repeat steps 2–3 for each additional chart. One at a time.

### Step 5 — Compose the Layout

Once all charts work individually, arrange them in `rows:` / `cols:`. The layout is the easy part — getting the queries right is the hard part.

```yaml
rows:
  - cols: [kpi_revenue, kpi_users, kpi_orders]
  - cols: [revenue_trend, 2]    # 2 = column span
  - cols: [by_region, by_product]
```

### Step 6 — Save the Final YAML

Write the YAML under `faces/` with your normal file-edit mechanism, then:

```bash
dft validate faces/finance/revenue-overview.yml
```


Fix any errors `dft validate` reports, then re-run until it passes.

## Parameterized Queries — Use From the Start

Use `{{ variable_name }}` syntax for any configurable values, even during exploration:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE region = '{{ region }}' AND date >= '{{ start_date }}'
```

Pass concrete values via the `variables` parameter when testing. When the query moves into dashboard YAML it works identically — and results are already cached.

**If you hardcode values during exploration and switch to variables later, the cache won't help because the SQL template changed.**

## Validate Early and Often

| Tool | When | What It Catches |
|------|------|-----------------|
| `dft query` | While drafting raw SQL | SQL errors, missing tables, wrong column names |
| `dft validate` | After every YAML edit | YAML schema errors, unknown fields, broken chart/query/layout references |
| `dft query --face` | After saving YAML with named queries | Actual named-query columns and sample rows |
| `dft render` | Before delivery | Query execution, render errors, layout issues, misleading visuals |

These tools are fast. Use them after every change, not just at the end.

`dft render` also returns a `warnings` list alongside errors. Warnings describe data-quality issues the renderer detected — empty columns, all-null series, suspicious value ranges. If `warnings` is non-empty, read each one: they often point to a fabrication inconsistency or a chart that will look wrong visually (e.g. a flat line because all values are null). Fix the underlying data and re-render.

## Self-Review Before Delivering

Run the review skill as the final step before declaring the face done:

- Run `dft skills dashboard-review` before declaring a face done.

It orchestrates structural (dft validate) and visual (PNG + vision) passes and returns a ranked findings list. Fix each `blocker`, then re-run the review. Rendering and validation are cached — the loop is cheap.

## Data Requirements Per Chart Type

**Inline data** (no database) — columnar format only. Each row is an array, column names declared once:
```yaml
queries:
  my_data:
    columns: [month, revenue, churn]
    values:
      - [2025-01-01, 284000, 3.2]
      - [2025-02-01, 301000, 2.9]
```
**Do not use `rows: [{col: val}, ...]`** — that format is not supported. `type: values` is optional and changes nothing; omit it.

Each chart type expects data in a specific shape. Dataface validates this and errors fast — no silent magic.

| Chart Type | Expected Data | Key Fields |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| `kpi`      | **Exactly 1 row** with a value column | `value` (column reference) |
| `line`     | Multiple rows, temporal x + numeric y | `x`, `y` |
| `bar`      | One row per category, numeric y       | `x`, `y` — categorical x auto-flips to horizontal; override with `style.orientation: vertical` only when needed |
| `area`     | Multiple rows, temporal x + numeric y | `x`, `y` |
| `scatter`  | Multiple rows, both x and y numeric   | `x`, `y` |
| `pie`      | One row per segment (pre-aggregated)  | `theta` (numeric) + `color` (category) |
| `heatmap`  | One row per cell (pre-aggregated)     | `x`, `y`, `color` |
| `table`    | Any number of rows and columns        | Use `style.columns` for per-column formatting: `- column: amount` / `format: currency_whole` / `label: Amount` / `align: right` / `width: 120` |

**Critical rules:**

- **KPI charts require exactly 1 row.** Aggregate to a single row: `SELECT SUM(amount) AS total FROM orders`. Multiple KPIs need separate single-row queries (or one query with multiple columns).
- **Pie and heatmap expect pre-aggregated data.** Use `GROUP BY` in the query. Dataface does NOT aggregate for you.
- **Don't mix metrics with very different magnitudes on one y-axis.** Metrics like churn (2–7%) and NRR (90–110%) on a shared axis will crush the smaller series flat. Use separate charts instead — there is no dual-axis support.
- **Multi-series line/bar/area: use `y: [col1, col2, col3]`.** Pass a list of column names to `y:` for multiple series on the same axis — no need for `type: layered`. Only use `type: layered` when layers need different chart types (e.g. bar + line overlay), and only if you supply the required `layers:` list.
- **Bar `color` creates grouped bars.** Setting `color` to a different field than `x` allocates one sub-band per color value per x-band. If each x-value belongs to only one color group (e.g. each person is in one team), all other sub-bands are empty and every bar is razor-thin. Only use a different `color` field when each x-value truly has multiple rows with different color values. Otherwise set `color` to the same field as `x`, or omit it.

## Formatting Numbers

Dataface does not auto-detect format from column names. Always set `format:` explicitly on any chart or KPI where the number type matters. Use a named preset:

| Preset | Example output | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| `integer` | `1,234` | |
| `currency_whole` | `$1,234` | |
| `currency_compact` | `$1.2M` | |
| `percent` | `2.3%` — input is decimal fraction (0.023) | line/bar/area/scatter |
| `percent_number` | `2.3%` — input is whole-number percent (2.3) | **KPI only** |
| `percent_delta` | `+2.3%` — input is decimal fraction | |
| `percent_number_delta` | `+2.3%` — input is whole-number (2.3) | **KPI only** |

**`percent_number` and `percent_number_delta` only work on `type: kpi`.** Using them on line/bar/area/scatter causes a render error. For those chart types use `percent` or `percent_delta` (decimal-fraction input) or omit `format:` entirely.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Building the entire dashboard in one pass | Build one chart at a time |
| Writing SQL without checking column names | Use `dft schema`, `dft schema -s`, or `dft query` first |
| Hardcoding values during exploration | Use `{{ variables }}` from the start so the query cache survives |
| Skipping validation between changes | `dft validate` after every YAML edit |
| Too many charts (>8) | Split into multiple dashboards |
| Using chart-type names as keys in layout | `table:` or `bar:` as keys cause parse errors — use descriptive names like `revenue_table` |
| Referencing query names in layout | Layout references charts, not queries — create a chart that wraps the query |
| KPI query returns multiple rows | Use `SUM()`/`COUNT()`/`AVG()` to aggregate to 1 row |
| Pie with raw unaggregated data | `GROUP BY` in query to aggregate before charting |
| Putting `height:` or `aspect_ratio:` under `style:` | Move them to chart root: `charts.my_chart.height: 400` — `style:` is paint only |
| Writing raw D3 format strings (`"$,.2s"`, `".1%"`) | Use a named preset (`currency_compact`, `percent`) — clearer and theme-consistent |
| Using `percent_number` or `percent_number_delta` on a line/bar/area chart | These are KPI-only — use `percent` or `percent_delta` instead (input must be decimal fraction 0–1) |
| Nesting `columns`/`values` under `sql:` for inline data | `sql:` is a string — inline data lives directly under the query name: `queries.my_data.columns: [...]` and `queries.my_data.values: [[...]]` |
| Using `type: values` + `rows:` for inline data | Not a valid query format — use `columns: [col1, col2]` + `values: [[row1val1, row1val2], ...]` directly under the query key |
| Using `type: layered` without `layers:` | `type: layered` requires a `layers:` list — or just use `y: [col1, col2]` on a regular line/bar/area chart for simple multi-series |

## Rationalizations to Resist

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "User asked for the whole dashboard at once" | Build incrementally anyway. Iterate to the result, don't one-shot it. |
| "I know what the columns are called" | You don't. Check with `dft schema`, `dft schema -s`, or `dft query`. |
| "Validation is slow, I'll do it at the end" | Validation is instant. Skipping it costs more time debugging later. |
| "It's just a quick chart, no need for variables" | Variables cost nothing and enable caching. Use them. |
| "User wants 15 charts on one dashboard" | 8 max. Propose splitting into focused dashboards. |

## Red Flags — STOP

- About to write SQL without having explored the actual schema first
- Building more than one new chart before validating the previous one
- Dashboard has more than 8 visualizations
- A chart exists without a clear question it answers
- Using hardcoded values that should be variables
- Delivering without running the self-review checklist
